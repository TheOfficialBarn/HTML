        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Aiden! I'm currently 18 and attending Andover High School, while being dual-enrolled in Butler Community College. 
                I have spent most of my life in Wichita; however, I am originally from Austin where the majority of my family lives. After 12 year,
                I plan on finally moving away from Wichita in order to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Kansas.
                In my freetime, I enjoy cooking, practicing my Spanish skills, and spending time with my girlfriend, friends, and family.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, this is the home page of my portfolio! The purpose of this cohesive project is to increase my understanding of html, css, and coding as a whole. 
                Click projects to explore my work.

            <p>Here is one of many inspiring quotes from a musical artist I love to listen to:</p>
