            <p>Brought to you by the Wichita Open Streets ICT organization!</p>

            <p id="north">Open Streets ICT is a FREE community building event that closes a usually busy street to traffic and opens it for biking, walking, running, dancing, yoga, and more! All Wichitans are invited to join in the fun, and to stop at the local businesses, restaurants, street vendors, and the major activity hubs situated every mile along the route.
                <br><br>
                Open Streets ICT provides more than just opportunities for physical exercise â€” it's an exercise in building community, cultural identity, and social engagement. By temporarily removing the danger of motor vehicles, Open Streets provide a novel type of public space that helps people make social connections and lets them view their city through a new lens.
                <br><br>
                Along the route there will be many restaurants, businesses and organizations participating with food, activities and fun for all ages and physical levels to enjoy.
