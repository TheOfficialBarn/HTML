  <h1>The Similarities Between Spanish &amp; HTML</h1>
</header>

<main>
<h2>Why I Chose This Idea</h2>
<p>For this project, I wanted to think about a topic and connect it, as well as the skills associated, to what I am currently learning in HTML and CSS. One subject that I am fairly well versed in that I believe perfectly fits this theme is Spanish. The grammar, memorization, reading, and writing aspects all pertain to HTML and the skills developed in one make learning the other more facile by an appreciable degree.
</p>

<h2>The Similarities</h2>
<p>In Spanish, a remarkable amount of vocabulary is cognate to English diction. For example, the word “Teléfono” is telephone, just what it sounds like in English. Another, more clear instance of this is in the word chocolate, cereal, or error – all of these words are spelt exactly like this in Spanish and pronounced nearly the same. Phrases have been replicated in both languages too; the phrase “for example” is “por ejemplo” in Spanish. After doing a little research, there are over one thousand common words and phrases used in English that sound almost identical to their Spanish counterparts. I thought this to be really cool because in HTML there are a plethora of commands used in the same way as English. title (with brackets) creates a title, header (with brackets) creates a header, and so on.
</p>
<p>Grammar is also a large factor in any language because each has its own original set of rules to get a message across. Some rules may be similar to those of other tongues, but all are composed largely of unique conventions. One aspect of grammar that is prominent in many languages is verb conjugation. While many don’t realize this, each verb in English has many different forms depending on the tense and subject. I run and I ran both use the same infinitive, to run. All that changed is the tense, which changed from present to past. While languages like Chinese and HTML, from my experience, only have one form, Spanish can have around twenty times that amount. The type of verb you use depends on factors such as tense, mood, subject, and command usage. Luckily, knowing which one to use is really easy once you get the hang of it. There are also many charts out there that remove any difficulty in learning conjugation. Almost all verbs are broken down into two parts: the stem and the end. For the most part, the stem stays the same no matter what conjugation you use. All that changes is the last two letters, which are always “ar”, “er”, or “ir” to begin with. For example, ayudar (to help) becomes ayudo when you change to the present self form. All that happened was the removal of the last two letters, and the addition of the letter "o". I know that conjugation isn’t related to HTML at all, but it does remind me of how you use a slash symbol in between brackets depending on if the command is opening or closing an instruction.
</p>
<p>A third way that HTML is ever so slightly similar to Spanish, and language learning as a whole, is in the memorization required. While coding apps like Visual Studio Code make this process much easier, there is no getting around it. Not only does one have to memorize the grammar rules, but also the commands, font names, and even style codes. I thought this to be akin to learning Spanish as, while I do have a translator/interpreter in my pocket at all times, it is not convenient nor efficient to pull it out every time I speak to someone or write in Spanish. Just like this, I don’t think that autofill suggestions should be relied on to remember different commands. Oftentimes, the ones I use don’t even appear.
</p>
<p>To wrap this topic up, I believe that the skills required in learning HTML correlate to Spanish speaking/writing skills in numerous ways. From mastering grammar to remembering all the different words and commands, both Spanish and HTML share many similarities when it comes to picking them up. Some schools even offer coding courses as a foreign language credit! I guess that is why many call HTML a coding “language.”
