            <p>While this stretches the definition of "packaged food," I believe that this still works. Sushi has to be one of my top 3 favorite dishes. Dillon's boxed sushi is no exception, just look at the reviews!</p>

            <h3>Where to Find</h3>
                <p>Most likely, you can find a variety of different packaged sushi rolls at any local Dillon's or Kroger's. Just make sure you stop by before 7pm, as that is when the store stops making them for the day. Doordash and other third-party apps may be able to fulfill your sushi desires as well.</p>
            <h3>Types of Rolls Offered</h3>
                <p>Here, you can find California rolls, immitation crab rolls, spicy tuna rolls, shrimp rolls, as well as a chef's choice platter. </p>
